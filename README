DNS Engine

Author: Garrett Long

multi-threaded applicaiton that resolves domain names to IP addresses

How to compile program:
1. Navigate to the folder containing multi-lookup.c.
2. Run the command "make".

How to run the program:
1. Navigate to the folder containing multi-lookup.c
2. Run the command "valgrind ./multi-lookup namefile1.txt namefile2.txt ... results.txt".
3. You may include as many namefiles as desired but only the first 10 will be resolved by the program

Benchmarks:
The fastest runtime occured when the number of resolver threads equaled the number of cores.
